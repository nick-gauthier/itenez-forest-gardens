# Pre-Columbian Forest Gardens in Bolivia's Iténez Preserve

**Mapping 180 km² of ancient landscape modification using AI-assisted archaeological detection**

> 🏆 **OpenAI to Z Challenge Entry** - Using GPT-4.1 and vision models to discover previously unknown archaeological sites in the Amazon rainforest

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis code and documentation for identifying extensive pre-Columbian forest gardens and anthropogenic soils across Bolivia's 4,000 km² Iténez Forest Preserve. Using satellite imagery and AI-assisted detection, we mapped over 350 individual sites spanning 180 km² of modified landscapes—filling a major gap in Amazonian archaeological knowledge.

## Key Findings

- **180 km²** of anthropogenic forest gardens identified (5% of preserve area)
- **350+ individual sites** ranging from 5-700 hectares
- Hierarchical settlement patterns with extensive earthwork networks
- Continuous landscape modification between previously studied regions
- Living heritage: local communities still harvest cacao from these ancient forests

## Methods

- **Satellite Analysis**: Sentinel-2 imagery from driest periods (2023-2024)
- **AI Detection**: GPT-4.1 and Moondream2 vision models for pattern recognition
- **Human Validation**: Expert archaeological interpretation and manual mapping

## Requirements

- R 4.0+
- Google Earth Engine access
- Required packages: `tidyverse`, `sf`, `mapview`, `tidyterra` `ellmer`

## Usage

1. Clone repository
2. Install required R packages
3. Run main analysis notebook
4. View results in interactive maps

## Significance

This work demonstrates that the "pristine" Amazon was extensively managed by Indigenous peoples, with ecological signatures persisting today. The human-AI partnership approach offers a scalable model for archaeological survey across forested regions.
